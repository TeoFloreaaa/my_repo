I've been tryna call 4 6 
I've been on my own for long enough 8 11 
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe 9 13 
I'm going through withdrawals 4 8 
You don't even have to do too much 8 12 
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby 10 12 
I look around and 4 7 
Sin City's cold and empty (oh) 6 6 
No one's around to judge me (oh) 7 11 
I can't see clearly when you're gone 7 12 
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights 8 10 
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch 9 14 *
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night 8 11 
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust 10 14 
(Hey, hey, hey) 3 3 
I'm running out of time 5 8 
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky 10 12 
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh 9 13 
The city's cold and empty (oh) 6 6 
No one's around to judge me (oh) 7 11 
I CAN'T SEE CLEARLY WHEN YOU'RE GONE 7 12 
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights 8 10 
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch 9 14 *
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night 8 11 
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust 10 14 
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know) 13 14 
I CAN NEVER SAY IT ON THE PHONE (SAY IT ON THE PHONE) 13 16 
Will never let you go this time (ooh) 8 12 
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights 8 10 
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch 9 14 *
(Hey, hey, hey) 3 3 
I SAID, OOH, I'M BLINDED BY THE LIGHTS 8 10 
NO, I CAN'T SLEEP UNTIL I FEEL YOUR TOUCH 9 14 *
